					What is Javascript?
				</header>
				<br>
				<p>
				JavaScript is a programming language that makes websites come to life! It's like magic, but instead of waving a wand, you write code.

Think of JavaScript like a little mischievous genie that lives inside your browser. When you tell it to do something, it pops out of the bottle and makes your website do cool things like pop-ups, animations, and interactive forms.
Here's a classic "Hello World" example in JavaScript:
				</p>
			
				<pre>
					<code class="code1">
					  alert("Hello World");
					</code>
				  </pre>
				<br>
				<p>
					Here are some of the important things to know about JavaScript:
				</p>
				<ul class="First_list">
					<li>Variables</li>
					<li>Data types</li>
					<li>Operators</li>
					<li>Control Structures</li>
					<li>Functions</li>
					<li>Arrays</li>
					<li>Objects</li>
					<li>DOM Manipulation</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section class="main-section" id="Object">
				<header>
					Variables
				</header>
				<p>
					In JavaScript, variables are like magic containers that you can use to store values. You can think of them like little treasure chests that you fill with gold (or, you know, strings, numbers, booleans, or whatever kind of treasure you're looking to hoard). The treasure chest has a label on it, which is the name of the variable, so you can easily find what you stored inside.
				Here's an example:
				<pre>
					<code class="code2">
						let chest = "gold";
						console.log(chest); // Output: gold
					</code>
				  </pre>
				</p>
				<p>In this example, we're declaring a variable called chest and storing the string "gold" in it. Then, we're using the console.log function to log the value stored in the chest variable to the console.
				</p>
				<p>So there you have it! Variables are like magic treasure chests that help you keep your values organized and easily accessible.
					With a bit of practice, you'll become the very Merlin of JavaScript.

					Data types
				</header>
				<p>
				In JavaScript, data types are like different types of costumes that you can wear. Some are flamboyant and full of flair (like strings), while others are simple and straightforward (like numbers). Just like costumes, data types help you express yourself and give your values a personality.

				Here's a quick rundown of the most common data types in JavaScript:

				<li> <b>String</b>: A string is like a fancy, glittering costume. It's used to represent text and can be anything from a single letter to a whole novel. You can think of strings as any text that you put inside quotation marks.</li>

				<li> <b>Number</b>: Numbers are like the plain, simple costume of the JavaScript world. They're used to represent numerical values and can be anything from integers to decimals.</li>

				<li> <b>Boolean</b>: Booleans are like the superhero costumes of JavaScript. They're used to represent binary values, which can only be true or false.</li>

				<li> <b>Null</b>: The null data type is like an empty costume rack. It's used to represent the absence of a value.</li>

				<li> <b>Undefined</b>: The undefined data type is like a missing costume. It's used to represent a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.</li>

				<p>Here's an example of how you might use these data types in JavaScript:</p>
				<pre> 
					<code class="code3">
						let string = "I'm a string";
						let number = 42;
						let boolean = true;
						let nothing = null;
						let missing = undefined;
					</code>
				</pre>
				
				<p>With the right data type, you can turn your values into anything from a sparkling string to a powerful boolean.</p>

				</p>

					Operators
				</header>
				<p>
					JavaScript operators are like tools in a toolbox. Just like a hammer helps you drive nails into wood, JavaScript operators help you perform operations on values and variables. For example, the addition operator (+) is like a ruler that helps you measure the sum of two numbers, while the assignment operator (=) is like a drill that helps you put a value into a storage box (a variable).

					<br>
					There are various types of operators in JavaScript, including arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, and more. 
					Here's an example of how you might use these operators in JavaScript:
					<pre>
						<code class="code4">
							let a = 2;
							let b = 3;
							let sum = a + b; // 5
							let difference = a - b; // -1
							let product = a * b; // 6

						</code>
					</pre>
				</p>

					Control Structures
				</header>

				<p>
					Just like traffic signals help control the flow of cars, control structures help control the flow of code execution in your program.

For example, the "if" statement is like a traffic light that only allows your code to proceed if a certain condition is met, just like a green light means "go" and a red light means "stop."

<br>The "for" loop is like a roundabout that helps you repeat a section of code a set number of times, just like a car going around the roundabout multiple times.

The "while" loop is like a drawbridge that only allows your code to proceed if a certain condition is met, raising and lowering as needed.

<br>And the "switch" statement is like a set of traffic lights at a construction site, directing the flow of code execution to different parts of your program based on different conditions.

So, just like how you obey traffic signals to safely navigate the roads, you use control structures in JavaScript to safely navigate the flow of code execution in your program.

					Functions
				</header>
				<p>
					A function has a name, a set of inputs (known as arguments), and a block of code that performs a specific task. Just like a recipe lists the ingredients and steps to make a dish, a function lists the inputs and the code that performs the task.

					When you call a function, you provide the necessary inputs (or arguments), and the code inside the function runs and produces a result. This is similar to following a recipe and combining the ingredients in the right way to produce a finished dish.

				<br>Functions can be reused and called multiple times in your code, just like how you can use the same recipe multiple times to make different meals. This helps you write cleaner, more organized, and reusable code.
				</p>

				<p>
					Here's an example of a simple JavaScript function that takes two numbers as inputs and returns their sum:
				<pre>
					<code class="code5">
						function addNumbers(a, b) {
							return a + b;
						  }
					</code>
				</pre>
				</p>
			<p>
				This function is named addNumbers, and it takes two arguments, a and b. The code inside the function uses the return keyword to return the sum of a and b as its result.
			<br>You can call this function by passing in two numbers as arguments, like this:
			<pre>
				<code class="code6">
					let result = addNumbers(5, 10);
					console.log(result); // Output: 15

				</code>
			</pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				Here, we call the addNumbers function and pass in 5 and 10 as arguments. The function runs and returns the sum of 5 and 10, which is 15. This result is stored in the variable result, and we use the console.log function to log the result to the console.
